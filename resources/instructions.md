# Coding Test Instructions


We have a simple products JSON array. We would like you to read the array and display it in an organized way.
Our recommendation is to not spend too much time trying to get it perfect, but demonstrate your skills through well-structured code and industry standard conventions.
This means code formatting, comments and readable variable names.
This will be our primary assessment focus.


Included is the data file and images, also find a file with a rough wireframe of how the end product should look.


Requirements:
• Build with MV* framework
• Read data from JSON
• Responsive Layout
• Display product image, name and price.
• Build dropdown filters for product type
• Hide and show data depending on the dropdown filters
• Show an indicator on the product if it is on sale.


Don't forget:
- The page should be responsive and that it displays elegantly on mobile through to desktop.
- Create a Github or Bitbucket repository and commit your work to this repository.
- Please refrain from committing all your code in one go as we would like to see a logical commit pattern as you create your solution and your GIT comment practices.
- Please surround your code with a few basic unit tests, the tests don’t need to be super granular but do write tests for all logical functionality.
- Include a Readme of how to use your repository.


You are free to use Bootstrap or any other grid frameworks. You can be as creative as you want with how you display the products on your page.


Again we would like to emphasize not to spend too much time on any one thing, we want to see how you work at covering the essentials not how well you do one particular thing.


When completed, please send your Github or Bitbucket repository to us for review.
